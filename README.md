# Dataquest Guided Project: Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings
*This is a Guided Project I completed for the Data Analyst/Data Science path on Dataquest. Dataquest does provide solution code that is available while completing this project. As a result, I do not claim that all of this code is mine or original. At times when I got stuck or when my code didn't fit the direction of the guided analysis, I matched their code for the sake of completing the exercise and learning the structure of the analysis.
So while the code is not 100% original or unique, I believe one of the strengths of these projects is that it helps students like me identify business problems where analysis like this can be valuable. As a result, I'm confident that I can adapt this particular analysis to similar business problems I may face in my day-to-day work.*

## Introduction
In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest (Fandango is an online movie ratings aggregator). He published his analysis [in this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) — a great piece of data journalism that's totally worth reading.

In this project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.

### Methods Used
- descriptive statistics
- sampling

### Technologies Used
- Python
    - Pandas
    - Numpy
    - Matplotlib

## Next Steps
These are a few next steps to consider:
- Customize your graphs more by reproducing almost completely the FiveThirtyEight style. You can take a look at this tutorial if you want to do that.
- Improve your project from a stylistical point of view by following the guidelines discussed in this style guide.
- Use the two samples to compare ratings of different movie ratings aggregators and recommend what's the best website to check for a movie rating. There are many approaches you can take here — you can take some inspiration from this article.
- Collect recent movie ratings data and formulate your own research questions. You can take a look at this blog post to learn how to scrape movie ratings for IMDB and Metacritic.
